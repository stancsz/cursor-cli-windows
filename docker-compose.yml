# docker-compose.yml

# Usage:
# 1) Build & start the container: docker compose up --build -d
# 2) Enter it: docker exec -it cursor-agent bash
# 3) Cursor CLI is installed during build and the entrypoint auto-starts the agent.
#
# Notes:
# - The repo root is mounted at /workspace so the Cursor agent can access files.
# - The image is built from the Dockerfile in this repo; the Dockerfile runs the
#   Cursor installer during build by default. Set INSTALL_CURSOR=false if you need
#   to skip that step and install manually inside the container later.
